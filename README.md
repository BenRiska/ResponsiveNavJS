# ResponsiveNavJS
A Responsive Burger Nav Made With JavaScript and CSS Animation/Transition.

As a sort of follow on exercise for my previous CSS burger nav repo, i decided to create a more complex version that (in my opinion) looks and works a lot slicker. 

Feel free to use it in your own work.

*the burger button only shows on mobile devices, can be changed in the css media query.
